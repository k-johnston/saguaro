Welcome to Glitch
=================

About: Knowledge is power - maybe our conversation is the seed for an interest in bringing native plants to your own yard! This chatbot was created by Kathryn Johnston for the DESIGN A FEMINIST CHATBOT course by UAL CREATIVE COMPUTING INSTITUTE https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/designing-a-feminist-chatbot. I have a few more chatbots that will talk with you about native plants in Arizona or California at [URL glitch collection]. You can even remix this chatbot to talk about plants in your area. Thanks to the resources amwua.org, azstateparks.com, wikipedia.org, and http://www.efloras.org/ for the information about common and native cacti in Arizona. All images are from Wikipedia, except for the photo of a Echinomastus erectocentrus which was taken by lonqueta and accessed on flickr https://www.flickr.com/photos/lonqueta/5681560518
