About Saguaro
=============

### ðŸŒµ Why a chatbot?

This chatbot was created for the capstone project in the [Design a Feminist Chatbot course](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/designing-a-feminist-chatbot) by UAL Creative Computing Institute.

The broader goal of this project is to address this question: How could a chatbot help people learn about the native plants in their area?

### ðŸŒµ Why cacti?

I'm from Arizona, but didn't know much about the many common and native varieties of cacti there. I wanted to learn more!

The scientific classification of cacti was a good constraint to structure and organize my project and keep a limited scope. I used these resources: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/), [Arizona Municipal Water Users Association](http://www.amwua.org/what-you-can-do/landscape-and-garden), [Arizona State Parks & Trails](https://azstateparks.com/), and the [eFloras database](http://www.efloras.org/index.aspx).

If you are interested in learning more about cacti or native plants in your region, I recommend these resources. Maybe this conversation is the seed that will inspire you to add them to your own yard and strengthen the biodiversity of your environment!

### ðŸŒµ Credits

The background splash image is by Dulcey Lima on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/Md-rgK-zwgU). All images within the chat are from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cactus), except for Echinomastus erectocentrus, which was taken by lonqueta and accessed on [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/lonqueta/5681560518). Thanks to everyone for allowing these images to be used.

The chat library is [bubbles.js](https://dmitrizzle.github.io/chat-bubble/).

### ðŸŒµ More plant chatbots

I'm planning more chatbots related to other Southwestern plants. You can also read more about this project [here](https://kathrynjohnston.substack.com/p/introducing-saguaro).

Also please remix this for the plants in your area! I'd love to learn more about them ðŸ˜Š
