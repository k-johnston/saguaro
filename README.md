### ðŸŒµ Why cacti?

I'm from Arizona, but didn't know much about the many common and native varieties of cacti there. I wanted to learn more!

The scientific classification of cacti was a good constraint to structure and organize my project and keep a limited scope. I used these resources: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/), [Arizona Municipal Water Users Association](http://www.amwua.org/what-you-can-do/landscape-and-garden), [Arizona State Parks & Trails](https://azstateparks.com/), and the [eFloras database](http://www.efloras.org/index.aspx).

If you are interested in learning more about cacti or native plants in your region, I recommend these resources. Maybe this conversation is the seed that will inspire you to add them to your own yard and strengthen the biodiversity of your environment!

### ðŸŒµ Why a chatbot?

This chatbot was created for the capstone project in the [Design a Feminist Chatbot course](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/designing-a-feminist-chatbot) by UAL Creative Computing Institute.

The chat library is [bubbles.js](https://dmitrizzle.github.io/chat-bubble/).

Thanks to everyone for allowing these images to be used.

### ðŸŒµ More plant chatbots

I have a few more chatbots in development based on this one:
- [California plants](https://hi-california-plant-friends.glitch.me/)
- [Arizona plants](https://hi-arizona-plant-friends.glitch.me/)
- [Western wildflowers](https://hi-wildflower-friends.glitch.me/)

Please remix this for the plants in your area! I'd love to learn more about them ðŸ˜Š
